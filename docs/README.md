# NPM Jeopardy Song

This is a very simple Node module that plays the 'Jeopardy' 'Final Jeopardy' song after it downloads to your local machine. I ultimately would like to create a program that plays the 'Final Jeopardy' song any time a new module or package is installed using `npm i <package>`. This project is just a fun personal project. It is not intended for serious use.
